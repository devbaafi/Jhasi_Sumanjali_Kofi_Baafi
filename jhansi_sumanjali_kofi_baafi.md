# Git Assignment Assessment for Jhansi Sumanjali

---

## Coverage of Commands

The following commands were proved to have been covered:

* init
* remote add
* add
* commit
* push
* branch
* checkout branch
* clone
* head
* reset
* tag *But peer needs better understanding of its benefits*
* log
* status
* pull
* fork

The following were not covered:

* stash *This was covered during the peer review*
* fetch *This was not discussed in peer review*
* setting

## Sequencing of Commands

Some commands are out of sequence for example:

* I expected to see status checks before commit
* I expected to see git log after commit and before push not at the end of the presentation

On the whole presentation is good.

## Differences with peer presentation

* Apart from differences in sequencing the commands, commands are well presented

## Commands not included

* diff *Shows the difference between versions of files*
* file checkout
* git ls-files
